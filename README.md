# Enhancing boards

Hello! This is a place I will be pushing KiCad boards and documentation for those.
I am doing that to be able to show, discuss and improve those boards, also I want them to be useful for someone.

There are lots of ready boards for DIY enthusiasts, but I can't always find a well-tested layout made in open-source software,
so that's something to improve, too. :-)

## Plans
I intend to test different microcontrollers and sound-related hardware,
testing what I can with toner-transfer method at home
and ordering boards online when there's a point to that.
