# Enhancing boards

Hello! This is a place I will be pushing KiCad boards and documentation for those.
I am doing that to be able to show, discuss and improve those boards, also I want them to be useful for someone.

There are lots of ready boards for DIY enthusiasts, but I can't always find a well-tested layout made in open-source software, so there's always something to improve, too. :-)

## Plans
I am interested in electronic music synthesizers and single-board computers that can be used in those; I intend to test different microcontrollers and sound-related hardware. Besides that, I have a ton of breakout boards from China. I want reusable layouts for chips, so that's something I'll gradually clean up and add here, too.

## Testing

When I can, I will test the boards using the toner-transfer method, adding a note about the results and fixing the boards. Otherwise, I'll order everything I can't make elsewhere.

If you want to do tests right now, **feel free to create an issue**! I will provide any additional info you'll want for toner-transfer method or I will help with factory Gerber.
