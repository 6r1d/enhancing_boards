# 16-pin analog / digital multiplexor breakout board

![Mux image](/MUX_4067/img/MUX_4067.png?raw=true)

## Generic info

I had some of those mux board around for quite some time and they are working nicely with Arduino, so I decided to make a copy of a very short schematic and to make my own layout. Why? Well, as usual, to test and be sure I can use them in my own devices later.

## Documentation

[Datasheet](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/cd74hc4067.pdf)

## To-Do

- [ ] Make a board
- [ ] Do a bunch of tests to determine it's not worse than normal breakout boards
- [ ] Create a 8-pin layout
